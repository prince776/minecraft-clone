# minecraftClone

This is a clone of minecraft in C++ with openGL.

I have written this only for purpose of exploring how to write a 3D mincraft like game.
That is why there's a lot of prototype-ish code, with lot of copy/move semantics bugs.

Infinite world gen works but something happens due to the move/copy semantics that results
in game crashing so it is disabled for now.

I have not implemented lots of game mechanics, simply for the reason that I wasn't interested.
Anyhow, here's a small screenshot of what it looks like
